# Nightsnack [WIP]
_Eat snacks at night and don't waste your time on downloading music from YouTube_

## Why?
To simplify your life. Wouldn't it be easy to sync easily your music to phone/laptop while you just add videos to your favourite YouTube playlist?

## How it does work?
It uses MongoDB to store user and video information and BitTorrent Sync for sending files

(TODO: BitTorrent Sync is proprietary and requires Pro licence for 10+ playlists, [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) might be better)

## Set up
You probably won't need to set up, because this is going to be a service.

BitTorrent Sync API Key (request it from their site), MongoDB, modules from `requrements.txt` and good uplink are required.

Google API key is very reccomended, because I don't know when Google changes Youtube page structure.
